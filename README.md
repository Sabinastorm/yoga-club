## Who is this website for?

This is a yoga studio website that offers classes in Vinyasa Flow. It is designed and created for a yoga studio to show classes and location of the studio to attract new customers. It is also designed and created for people who live in or near Stockholm, Sweden to find the studio and information about what it can offer and sign up for classes.
