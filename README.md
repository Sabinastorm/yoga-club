Testing
Browser Testing
Website has been tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox and Opera.

It was tested on two mobile devices OnePlus and Apple Iphone. Both thsts confirmed that website works great.

On each browser the website works as inteded visually and all the functionality of the website works as intended.

Validators
The website has been through W3C Jigsaw validation with 2 errors. The errors are located inside bootstrap CDN and I have no control over it.

URI : https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootswatch/4.5.2/sandstone/bootstrap.min.css
12 abbr[title], abbr[data-original-title] Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
12 .accordion Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none
Website has been through W3C HTML Validator and there is no issues to report.

Local Testing
Local testing of all the buttons, links and functionality of the website has been carried out. There was few links which needed to be fixed and that was done.

While testing forms I have discovered that all the fields are not being focused on when clicked. That has been fixed by matching ID in label and in input lines.

Hamburger toggler button was not centered and that was fixed by adding some additional CSS to it.

Responsiveness
I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to check the responsiveness of website. Mobile, tablet and desktop sizes were tested and all worked well. It also responded on each breakpoint that were set up on Media Query's and no visual or functional errors found

Issue
Bigest issue that I have encountered was the responsivenes of the carousel images. The images look perfact (as intended) on mobile and on tablet screens. The issue is happening with desktop and large desktop screens where images might look a bit streched. This project was focused on mobile first design so the images look perfect on mobile and medium devices. I have made sure that they are acceptable on large and extra large screens.

Version Control
Git & GitHub
I used GitPod as a local repository and IDE and GitHub as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

First i created a new repository on GitHub
I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders
I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
Process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows (done in terminal):
git add . for adding work to git
git commit -m "Commit message" to commit the work on the stage
git push to update work to GitHub
Deployment
To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on GitHub.

Go to "Settings" on the repository
On "Source" of "GitHub Pages", select "master for Branch and click save
The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section
Oracle recruitment
As one of the owners and directors of Oralce Recruitment company I will use this project as a starting point for the companies website. In the following lessons I will further expand on website's functionality and practical usage. All the items listed as features left to implement will be inplemented in future and the website will be hosted on our Digital Ocean server which currently hosts the Wordpress website for the company.
